# Trigger-Word-Detection
Construct a speech dataset and implement an algorithm for trigger word detection (sometimes also called keyword detection, or wakeword detection). 
Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word.  

-> Structure a speech recognition project 
-> Synthesize and process audio recordings to create train/dev datasets
-> Train a trigger word detection model and make predictions
